/*What is Functional Programing : A mindset

Functional Programing is a programing paradigm-a style of bulding the structure and element of computer program- that treats computation as the "evaluations of mathmatical functions" and 
"avoids changing-state" and
"mutable data"-Wikipedia

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in """pure mathematical functions style""".

Functional programming (FP) is an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software. In other words, building programs by applying and composing functions

Programming Languages that support functional programming: Haskell, JavaScript, Python, Scala, Erlang, Lisp, ML, Clojure, OCaml, Common Lisp, Racket. 

 Main Three Terms

1. Pure Function
2. First Class Function
3. Higher Order Function
