Primitive data type -> are defined by JavaScrift

        Null
        bigint

//Object type -> user define data type

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

"number" :  for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
"bigint" : is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
"string" : for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
"boolean": for true/false.
"null": for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
"undefined" : for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
"object" : for more complex data structures.
"symbol" : for unique identifiers.
The latest ECMAScript standard defines nine types:

Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:
undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"
Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
Number : typeof instance === "number"
String : typeof instance === "string"
BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"
Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"
