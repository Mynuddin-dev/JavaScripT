Getting know about OOP let we know how the developers write code before OOP comes?

They follow procedural way rather than any structural way to write code.
Procedural Programing :
-----------------------
In procedural programming, the focus is on writing procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. These procedures manipulate data and are organized in a linear fashion. The program's logic revolves around executing these procedures one after another, with data often shared globally.

How Code Was Written in Procedural Programming:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Data and Function: Data and functions are separate entities. Functions act on data and can modify it, leading to a global data space where data is accessible from anywhere in the program
2. Global Scope: lead unintended side effect and make the ode harder to understand and maintain.
3.Complexity: As programs grew larger and more complex, managing data and ensuring its integrity became challenging. Code could become difficult to maintain and debug due to its sprawling nature.

Then first comes STRUCT:Common data in a struct and we can create many user object as we can. And there is also many disadvantages.

There is some serious issue we face when we create software for real world.
1. Code is not reusable.
2. Large code is hard to manage.
3. Difficult to tracing and fixing bugs.
4. Data is exposed to whole program(global scope)
5. Here, operation's priority is higher than data
6. Difficult to relate with real world data

So what's the solution ? : OOP
------------------------------
Programming is like giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks. As your programs become more complex, organizing and managing your code becomes important. That's where Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes in!

This is a way of writing computer programs by organizing your code into reusable pieces called "objects." These objects represent real-world things or concepts, and they have both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP allows you to model and solve complex problems in a more structured and organized manner.
 
Class: A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. For example, if you have a class called "Car," it might have attributes like "color" and "model," and methods like "start_engine."

Object: An object is an instance created from a class. If a class is a blueprint, an object is a specific realization of that blueprint. You can create multiple objects from the same class, each with its own unique data.

Attributes: Attributes are the characteristics or properties of an object. For instance, a "Car" object might have attributes like "color," "model," and "year."

Methods: Methods are the functions or actions that an object can perform. For our "Car" example, methods could include "start_engine," "accelerate," and "brake."
